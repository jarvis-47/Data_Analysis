# Project 4: Advanced Statistical Modeling and Variable Selection

## Overview
The assignment involves advanced statistical modeling, variable selection, and interpretation of results.

## Problems

### Problem 1
**Tasks:**
- Fit a linear model with lean body mass (lbm) as the response variable and sport as a predictor using the `ais` dataset.
- Plot boxplots for lbm according to sport.
- Interpret the F-test and coefficient estimates for the model.
- Use model contrasts to estimate and provide confidence intervals for the difference in lean body mass between Tennis and W_Polo athletes.
- Add height (ht) to the model and interpret the new coefficient estimates.

### Problem 2
**Tasks:**
- Fit a model with fertility as the response variable and ppgdp, lifeExpF, and pctUrban as predictors using the `UN11` dataset.
- Plot fitted values versus residuals and scatterplot pairs.
- Fit the model with log(ppgdp) and log(fertility) and interpret the results.
- Provide updated model fits and residual plots.

### Problem 3
**Tasks:**
- Derive the expectation and variance of the vector of residuals using vector and matrix notation.
- Find the distribution of a linear combination of predictors plus a constant.

### Problem 4
**Tasks:**
- Perform variable selection using forward, backward, and stepwise approaches with AIC as the selection criterion using the `swiss` dataset.
- Compare the selected models and determine the best predictors for Fertility.
