# Assignment 1: Statistical Analysis and Data Manipulation

## Overview
This repository contains the solutions and code for Assignment 1 of the Data Analysis course, part of my Master's in Computer Science. The assignment involves statistical analysis and data manipulation tasks.

## Problems

### Problem 1
Transformation and analysis of random variables \(X\) and \(Y\), including expectation and variance calculations for \(Z = a - Y\) and \(U = bX + d\), and \(U^2\).

### Problem 2
Analysis of the `UrbanPop` variable from the `USArrests` dataset using R:
- Plotting `UrbanPop`
- Calculating mean and standard deviation
- Fitting a Normal density
- Plotting the CDF
- Probability calculations
- Finding the 75th percentile

### Problem 3
Statistical analysis of exam results for 20 students with a 70% pass probability:
- Expected number of passes
- Variance of passes
- Probability calculations for specific scenarios

### Problem 4
Derivation of the CDF for a random variable with a given density function and maximum likelihood estimation for the parameter \(\lambda\).
