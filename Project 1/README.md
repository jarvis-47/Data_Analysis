# Assignment 1: Statistical Analysis and Data Manipulation

## Overview
This repository contains the solutions and code for Assignment 1 of the Data Analysis course, part of my Master's in Computer Science. The assignment covers various problems involving statistical analysis and data manipulation.

## Problem 1
We studied two random variables, \(X\) and \(Y\), and defined transformations \(Z = a - Y\) and \(U = bX + d\). This problem involves expressing the expectation and variance of \(Z\) and \(U\) and finding the expectation and variance of \(U^2\).

## Problem 2
Using the `USArrests` dataset in R, we analyze the `UrbanPop` variable. Tasks include plotting the variable, fitting a normal density, plotting the cumulative distribution function (CDF), and calculating probabilities and percentiles.

## Problem 3
We have a class of 20 students taking an exam, with each student having a 70% chance of passing. We calculate the expected number of students passing, the variance, and probabilities for specific scenarios.

## Problem 4
We derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a given density function and find the joint likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimator for the parameter \(\lambda\) of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables.
