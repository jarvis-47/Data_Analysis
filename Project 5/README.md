# Project 5: Generalized Linear Models and Logistic Regression

## Overview
The assignment involves working with generalized linear models (GLMs) and logistic regression to analyze a diabetes dataset and model patient data.

## Problems

### Problem 1
**Tasks:**
- Load the diabetes dataset and identify the components of a generalized linear model (GLM).
- Fit a GLM with diabetes as the response variable and glucose, pressure, bmi, and age as predictors using a logit link function.
- Interpret the estimated coefficients for the predictors.
- Test whether the regression coefficient for age is equal to 0.05 at the \(\alpha = 0.05\) significance level.
- Calculate 90% confidence intervals for each of the coefficients.
- Estimate the probability of being diagnosed with diabetes for specific predictor values and analyze the impact of varying pressure on the probability.

### Problem 2
**Tasks:**
- Identify the correct distribution and link function for modeling the number of patients for doctors.
- Write down the log-likelihood for the corresponding GLM.
- Derive the first and second derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to the regression coefficients.
- Determine the entries of the Fisher information matrix for the model.
