# Data Analysis

## Overview
The course covers various topics in statistical analysis, regression modeling, hypothesis testing, and generalized linear models (GLMs), with practical applications using R.

## Projects

### Project 1: Statistical Analysis and Data Manipulation
- **Problem 1**: Transformation and analysis of random variables \(X\) and \(Y\).

- **Problem 3**: Statistical analysis of exam results for 20 students.
- **Problem 4**: Derivation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a random variable and maximum likelihood estimation for the parameter \(\lambda\).

### Project 2: Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing
- **Problem 1**: Maximum likelihood estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing for a normal population.
- **Problem 2**: Sample size determination for a desired margin of error.
