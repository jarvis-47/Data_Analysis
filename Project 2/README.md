# Assignment 2: Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

## Overview
This repository contains the solutions and code for Assignment 2 of the Data Analysis course, part of my Master's in Computer Science. The assignment involves statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling.

## Problems

### Problem 1
**Tasks:**
- Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate for the population mean.
- Provide a 92% confidence interval for the population mean.
- Perform a hypothesis test to determine if the true mean is different from 11 (α = 0.05).
- Provide a 90% confidence interval for the population variance.

### Problem 2
**Tasks:**
- Derive a formula for the sample size (n) as a function of the margin of error (ME).
- Calculate the minimum sample size needed to produce a confidence interval with a margin of error of 0.25 (α = 0.05).

### Problem 3
**Tasks:**
- Plot test scores for two classes and calculate average test scores.
- Perform a hypothesis test to compare the average test scores of two classes (α = 0.05 and α = 0.01).

### Problem 4
**Tasks:**
- Analyze the `trees` dataset in R.
- Plot Volume versus Height.
- Fit a simple linear regression model.
- Calculate least squares estimates and interpret them.
- Calculate the least squares estimate and maximum likelihood estimate for σ².
