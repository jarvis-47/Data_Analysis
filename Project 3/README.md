# Assignment 3: Advanced Statistical Analysis and Regression Modeling

## Overview
This repository contains the solutions and code for Assignment 3 of the Data Analysis course, part of my Master's in Computer Science. The assignment covers advanced statistical analysis and regression modeling tasks.

## Problems

### Problem 1
**Tasks:**
- Plot Volume versus Height for the `trees` dataset.
- Fit a simple linear regression model (SLR) and plot the regression line.
- Calculate least squares estimates (LSE) for \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\), and interpret them.
- Calculate LSE and maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for \(\sigma^2\).
- Provide 90% confidence intervals for \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\).
- Perform a hypothesis test for \(\beta_1\) with \(H_0: \beta_1 \geq 0.5\) and \(H_A: \beta_1 < 0.5\) at \(\alpha = 0.05\).

### Problem 2
**Tasks:**
- Find the covariance between \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\).

### Problem 3
**Tasks:**
- Analyze the `family_heights.txt` dataset:
  - Plot sons' heights versus fathers' heights with a regression line.
  - List and interpret the slope estimate.
  - Plot residuals and a Normal QQ plot of the residuals, and interpret them.
  - Provide a 95% confidence interval and a 95% prediction interval for the height of a son whose father is 70 inches tall.

### Problem 4
**Tasks:**
- Analyze the effects of scaling variables in a regression model:
  - Determine the changes in regression estimates when scaling \(x_i\) by a constant \(c\).
  - Determine the changes in regression estimates when scaling \(y_i\) by a constant \(a\).
